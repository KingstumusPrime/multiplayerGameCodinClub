# Slime City

This was a little multiplayer game I had created for my FLVS coding club. While not the most technically impressive thing I made it was a massive hit. Over time I expanded on it to add weapons, chat, bosses, and even enemy AI. The project leveraged a firebase database as the server so while being super pracitcal it was never super fast. This and the fact that I was starting to shift interests into CPU design caused the project to end. It can be played [here](https://multiplayer-game-160be.web.app/). But the database may be inactive these days.
