# Slime City

This was a little multiplayer game I had created for my FLVS coding club. While not the most technically impressive thing I made, it was a massive hit. Over time I expanded on it to add weapons, chat, bosses, and even enemy AI. The project leveraged a Firebase database as the server, so while being super practical, it was never super fast. This and the fact that I was starting to shift interests into CPU design caused the project to end. It can be played [here](https://multiplayer-game-160be.web.app/). But the database may be inactive these days.

# How to Play

To play the game, simply go to https://multiplayer-game-160be.web.app/. Going up to the cafe allows you to buy mana for 10 coins, and going to the pizza shop lets you buy health for 10 coins (space to open shop). You can also go to the castle, where you can get a ton of coins fighting knights.

While this is not the most recent version of the game, this has got to be my favorite photo, as it had the whole club together hanging out in something I made. In addition, I also remember having to kill the "Slime King" in the database because so many users were breaking the server.
